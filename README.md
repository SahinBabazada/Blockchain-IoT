# IoT Data Encryption and Blockchain Integration

This project demonstrates how to securely transmit data from IoT devices over MQTT, encrypt the data using symmetric key encryption, and store it on a blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts.

## Features

- MQTT communication for IoT device data transmission
- Symmetric key encryption for data security
- Integration with Ethereum blockchain for data immutability and transparency
- Simulation of IoT devices generating and transmitting data
- Error logging for debugging purposes

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Paho MQTT Python library (`pip install paho-mqtt`)
- Web3 Python library (`pip install web3`)
- Ganache or other Ethereum client for local blockchain simulation
- Solidity compiler for compiling smart contracts

## Setup

1. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install paho-mqtt web3
